# js13k2025 - Chickpocalypse Meow!

This is my entry for the 2025 js13kgames.com competition. The theme was "Black Cat".

It was made working on and off for about a week before the deadline. Maybe one year I'll actually have a good idea right from the start on August 13th!

It's meant to be a bit of a chaotic game. It's meant to be difficult.

# How to play

Use your mouse to drag and drop cute little chicks out of the paths of attacking black cats. You have a very limited amount of time per level.

The number of cats increases every level until there is no escape. The Chickpocalypse is inevitable!
